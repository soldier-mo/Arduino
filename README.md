# Arduino Projects Repository

Welcome to my Arduino projects repository! This repository contains various Arduino projects organized into separate folders. Each project folder includes essential files to help understand and replicate the project.

## Project Structure
Each project is structured as follows:

- **`code/`**: Contains the Arduino source code (`.ino` files and possibly other related scripts).
- **`code.png`**: An image representation of the code.
- **`plan.png`**: A diagram showing the physical layout of components.
- **`schem.png`**: A schematic representation of the circuit.
- **(Optional) `.fzz` files**: Some projects include `.fzz` files for use with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/), a tool for circuit design and visualization.

## Requirements
- **Arduino Board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Mega, etc.)
- **Arduino IDE** (Download from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software))
- **Fritzing** (Optional, for `.fzz` files)
- Required electronic components as specified in each project's diagrams
